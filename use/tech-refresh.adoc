If you have existing assets in place and want to determine whether a technology refresh is recommended, you can use the BlueXP economic efficiency Tech refresh options. You can either take a short assessment of your current workloads and get recommendations or you can perform a workload simulation to see how your workloads perform on new hardware. 

* <<Take a refresh assessment>>
* <<Simulate workloads on new hardware>>

Systems are considered candidates for a tech refresh based on the following: 

* Nearing the end of the Tech Support contract
* Nearing the end of the hardware lifecycle

== Take a refresh assessment 

The assessment includes the following steps: 

* Select the systems you want to assess. 
* Specify your requirements regarding environments, workload types, capacity, performance, and budget. 
* View the recommendations regarding appropriate products and cloud services that might improve performance in your environment. 



.Steps 

. From the BlueXP left navigation, select *Governance* > *Economic efficiency* > *Tech refresh*. 
+

. Look at the *Tech refresh candidates* tab, which lists all the working environments that might benefit from a tech refresh. 
. Select the working environment on which you want to obtain an assessment. 
. On the right in the Take action column, select *Evaluate refresh*. 
+ 
The Evaluate refresh options page shows the refresh assessment and the workload simulation options. 
+

. In the Evaluate refresh options page, select *Take assessment*. 
. Select the system or systems on which you want the assessment performed and select *Next*. 
. Define the requirements: 
.. *Environments*: Select the types of environment that you want: public cloud, hybrid cloud, or on-premises.

.. *Workloads*: Select all the types of workloads that you want to handle: Business critical applications, high performance analytics and computing, data lakes and media workflows, secondary storage, or less critical workloads. 
.. *Capacity*: Enter the capacity requirements in TiB, slide the slider to the value, or place your cursor on the value in the slider and select *Next*. 
.. *Performance*: Select the performance aspects that you want to be able to handle: lowest latency, highest IOPS, mixed workloads, or performance not important and select *Next*. 
.. *Budget*: Enter a budget in US dollars, slide the slider to the value, or place your cursor on the value in the slider and select *Next*.
+
A set of recommendations appears in different tabs for the options you chose.

. Review the recommendations. 
. Do one or both of the following: 
.. To download a PDF of the recommendations, select *Download*. 
.. To connect with a NetApp Sales Representative regarding the recommendations, select *Contact NetApp Sales*. A web page shows options you can choose from to contact a NetApp Sales representative. 



== View technology refresh assessments already taken

You might want to review the technology refresh assessments that you already took and review the recommendations again.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP left navigation, select *Governance* > *Economic efficiency* > *Tech refresh*. 

. Select the *Tech refresh candidates* tab, which lists all the systems on which you took a technology refresh assessment. Then, select *View action* on the row to see the assessments and recommendations for that system. 
+ 
Alternatively, select the row on which "Action taken" appears and select *View* to see that system's details. 

. In the Evaluate refresh options page, select *View recommendation*.
. View the refresh recommendations.

== Simulate workloads on new hardware 

You can perform a simulation to see how your workloads perform on new hardware. 

You can include or exclude specific workloads from the simulation. You can also add workloads if they don't appear in the existing workload list. 

.Steps 

. From the BlueXP left navigation, select *Governance* > *Economic efficiency* > *Tech refresh*. 
+

. Look at the *Tech refresh candidates* tab, which lists all the working environments that might benefit from a tech refresh. 
. Select the working environment on which you want to obtain an assessment. 
. On the right in the Take action column, select *Evaluate refresh*. 
+ 
The Evaluate refresh options page shows the refresh assessment and the workload simulation options.
+

. In the Simulate workloads > Workload requirements page, do the following: 
.. To add a workload not already in the list, select *Add workload*. For details, see <<Add a workload>>.
.. *IOPS*: Enter the IOPs that you want for your new hardware. 
.. *Capacity in TiB*: Enter the capacity that you want for your new hardware. 
.. *Exclude*: To exclude workloads, select the *Exclude* option in the Actions column. 
+
TIP: To include previously excluded workloads, select the *Excluded workloads* tab and select the *Include* option on the right. 
.. Select *Next*. 

. Review the simulated results on new hardware on the Configuration page:

. To download a PDF of the recommendations, select *Download*. 

. Select *Next*.

. To connect with a NetApp Sales representative regarding the recommendations, enter contact details. 

. Add special notes for the NetApp Sales Representative. 

. Select *Confirm and submit*. 

.Result

The recommendations from the workload simulation are sent to a NetApp Sales Representative. You will also receive an email confirming the recommendations. A NetApp Sales Representative will respond to your request. 

== Add a workload

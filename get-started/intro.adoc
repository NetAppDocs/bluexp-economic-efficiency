BlueXP economic efficiency identifies storage assets with current or forecasted low capacity and provides recommendations on data tiering or additional capacity (for AFF systems). If you choose to add capacity, a request with detailed recommendations is forwarded to you and to a NetApp representative. This request includes the details needed to make a capacity selection and order request easy. 

The service can be accessed in BlueXP under the *Governance* category. 

BlueXP economic efficiency applies to on-premises AFF systems only (including unified AFF and all SAN array systems).

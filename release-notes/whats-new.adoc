//tag::whats-new[]

== 14 March 2024 

If you have existing assets in place and want to determine whether a technology needs to be updated, you can use the BlueXP economic efficiency technology refresh options. You can either review a short assessment of your current workloads and get recommendations, or if you sent AutoSupport logs to NetApp within the past 90 days, the service can now provide a workload simulation to see how your workloads perform on new hardware.

You can also add a workload and exclude existing workloads from the simulation. 

Previously, you could only take an assessment of your assets and identify whether a technology refresh is recommended. 

The feature is now part of the Tech refresh option in the left navigation.
